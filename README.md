# Sprint 1: Build a Signup Form

Today's assignment is to build a signup form for a web service and style this according to how you want it to look. In the end you will also post the data from the form into a service called HTTPbin and it should show the data you put in. It is basically a server and will work in the same was as if we posted this data to our own server to for example create a user account. 

## How to complete this assignment

1. Go online and find a page with a form that you like the looks of. Today you choose which page with a form you want to copy. Add the page that you are copying into the Readme file in your Github repo for this assignment.  

1. Build a form that at a minimum contains: 
* 2 x Text fields
* 1 x A password field
* 1 x Radio button
* 1 x Checkbox
* 1 x Submit button

2. Set the form action to post to `https://httpbin.org/post` and the method set to `post`. This means that httpbin will mirror the response from the form. Try sumbitting your form and see if you can se the response on httpbin. 

3. Let's poke around with your form and see what response you get for the following scenarios: 
*

4. How should you protect passwords? 


1. Add an `in-focus` effect for when you click on the fields. Make the border or the background of the field change colour and add a glow effect.

1. Style the rest of the page and the form so that it looks like the one you picked. 

The `starter-code` folder containers a boilerplate html file and css. 

To complete this assignment, you need to fork this repository, make changes to your copy, and then submit a pull request on GitHub (from your repository into the technigo one) for review. Don't forget to add a link to your inspiration for your form into the `readme-file`.
